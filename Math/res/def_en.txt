1@A symbol for a number we don't know yet. It is usually a letter like x or y.
2@The exponent of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication.
3@The number that gets multiplied when using an exponent.

5@A symbol or a combination of symbols used in algebra, containing one or more numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations.
6@A fixed value. In Algebra, a constant is a number on its own, or sometimes a letter such as a, b or c to stand for a fixed number.
7@A number used to multiply a variable. Variables with no number have a coefficient of 1. Sometimes a letter stands in for the number.

23@The order of grouping the numbers does not matter. This law holds for addition and multiplication but it doesn’t hold for subtraction and division.
24@Zero added to any number is the number itself. The number 1 multiplied times any number gives the number itself.
25@The product of any number and zero is zero. It doesn't matter what the number is, when you multiply it to zero, you get zero as the answer.
26@The number -1 multiplied times any number gives the number itself with the opposite sign (positive or negative).

39@Is an equation with two or more inequalities joined together with either "and" or "or".
40@The set made by combining the elements of two sets. So the union of sets A and B is the set of elements in A, or B, or both. The symbol is a special "U" like this: ∪.
41@The intersection of two sets has only the elements common to both sets. If an element is in just one set it is not part of the intersection. The symbol is an upside down U like this: ∩.
42@A collection of "things" (objects or numbers, etc). Each member is called an element of the set. A set has only one of each member (all members are unique).
43@How to describe a set by saying what properties its members have.
44@ is a way to describe continuous sets of real numbers by the numbers that bound them.
45@A special relationship where each input has a single output. It is often written as "f(x)" where x is the input value.

75@
76@When solving an equation, we are trying to find the number that, when substituted, will make a true sentence.
77@The method of solving "by substitution" works by solving one of the equations (you choose which one) for one of the variables (you choose which one), and then plugging this back into the other equation, "substituting" for the chosen variable and solving for the other. Then you back-solve for the first variable.
78@In the elimination method you either add or subtract the equations to get an equation in one variable. When the coefficients of one variable are opposites you add the equations to eliminate a variable and when the coefficients of one variable are equal you subtract the equations to eliminate a variable.
79@Lines on a plane that never meet. They are always the same distance apart.

82@A linear inequality is an inequality which involves a linear function. A linear inequality contains one of the symbols of inequality. It shows the data which is not equal in graph form.
